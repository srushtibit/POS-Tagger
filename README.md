# POS-Tagger
In this problem, you will develop the skills in Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, the
process of assigning a part-of-speech tag (Noun, Verb, Adjective...) to each word in an
input text. Tagging is difficult because some words can represent more than one part of
speech at different times. They are Ambiguous. Let&#39;s look at the following example:
 The whole team played well. [adverb]
 You are doing well for yourself. [adjective]
 Well, this assignment took me forever to complete. [interjection]
 The well is dry. [noun]
 Tears were beginning to well in her eyes. [verb]
